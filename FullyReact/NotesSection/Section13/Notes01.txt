HOOKS:
Only call hooks at the top level 
Only call hooks from React function 

In, hooks. React only look useState hook value in initial state. When we change after 
initial state. It is not going to change the value of the useState() hook.

You should useState with callback function generally not every case. Keep in mind that it works with async way that is the 
reason you should usestate with callback when your code going to use async way.
